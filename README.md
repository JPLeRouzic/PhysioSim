# PhysioSim
This will be a human physiology simulator that aims at creating drugs ex silico. This will have several advantages, it will reduce both the animal experiments and clinical trials. At the moment it does not work, only some parts are somewhat near Alpha stage. The main inspiration for the Gui is BioDmet from General Electric, it uses the same idea of representing organs as a tree. Like other simulators it has several ODE solvers but at some time we will try Probabilistic Programming in order to make it possible to start from the intended result and progress toward a model description. This will speed up hypothesis testing. The physiology model is implemented at organ level (or below) by SBML format. The idea is that the user could use the tree to substitute as tiny modelized parts as needed, in place of the provided models, in order to implement their project.
